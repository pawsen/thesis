\chapter{From identification to design}
\label{chap:ident_to_design}

This chapter deals with the prediction of behaviour of nonlinear system, after
nonlinear components have been determined. Paraphrased it could be called
\textit{virtual prototyping}. Here methods to detect bifurcations, stability and
internal resonance are presented. The long-term ambition is to use this
knowledge to improve design, taking nonlinear behaviour into account.


This chapter represent a change of methodology. Where the methods for
identification in the previous chapter relied exclusively on time signals, the
methods of this chapter relies exclusively on FE models.
An natural extension, where the information from identification is used to build
an accurate computer model.
By accurate model, is meant a model where the $n$ lowest eigenfrequencies match
the experimental ones.


Two methods are treated: Harmonic balance(HB) continuation, used for detecting
and identifying bifurcations, and nonlinear normal modes(NNM) continuation, used
to detect internal resonance.


MÃ¥ske til opsummering:
(This is a step forward from the traditional methods used today where designs are
based on shaping resonance(by solving eigenvalue problems) and validated with
modal responses from experimental data.)
