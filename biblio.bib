  Abstract                 = {In Refs. [1,2], an effective implicit time integration scheme was proposed for the finite element solution of nonlinear problems in structural dynamics. Various important attributes were demonstrated. In particular, it was shown that the scheme remains stable, without the use of adjustable parameters, when the commonly used trapezoidal rule results in unstable solutions. In this paper we focus on additional important attributes of the scheme, and specifically on showing that the procedure can also be effective in linear analyses. We give, in comparison to other methods, the spectral radius, period elongation, and amplitude decay of the scheme and study the solution of a simple ‘model problem’ with a very flexible and stiff response.},

  Abstract                 = {A method for treating a complex structure as an assemblage of distinct regions, or substructures, is presented. Using basic mass and stiffness matrices for the substructures, together with conditions of geometrical compatibility along substructure boundaries, the method employs two forms of generalized coordinates. Boundary generalized coordinates give displacements and rotations of points along substructure boundaries and are related to the displacement modes of the substructures known as `constraint'. All constraint modes are generated by matrix operations from substructure input data. Substructure normal-mode generalized coordinates are related to free vibration modes of the substructures relative to completely restrained boundaries. The definition of substructure modes and the requirement of compatibility along substructure boundaries lead to coordinate transformation matrices that are employed in obtaining system mass and stiffness matrices from the mass and stiffness matrices of the substructures. Provision is made, through a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, for reducing the total number of degrees of freedom of a structure while retaining accurate description of its dynamic behavior. Substructure boundaries may have any degree of redundancy. An example is presented giving a free vibration analysis of a structure having a highly indeterminate substructure boundary.},

However, its use was so far limited to the approximation and study of periodic solutions, and other methods as the shooting and orthogonal collocation techniques were usually preferred to further analyze these solutions and to study their bifurcations. This is why the present paper intends to demonstrate how one can take advantage of the HB method as an efficient alternative to the cited techniques. Two different applications are studied, namely the normal modes of a spacecraft and the optimization of the design of a vibration absorber. The interesting filtering feature of the HB method and the implementation of an efficient bifurcation tracking extension are illustrated.},

A specific challenge encountered with fighter aircraft, besides aeroelastic nonlinearity, is the modelling of the wing-to-payload mounting interfaces. For large amplitudes of vibration, friction and gaps may be triggered in these connections and markedly impact the dynamic behaviour of the complete structure. In this series of two papers, the nonlinear dynamics of an F-16 aircraft is investigated using rigorous methods applied to real data collected during a ground vibration test campaign. The present work focuses on the analysis of sine-sweep measurements in order to get an insightful understanding about the nonlinear behaviour of the aircraft. To this extent, restoring force surface and wavelet transform methods are applied both on the collected GVT data and simulation results performed on a simple numerical model of the F-16 wing and its payload.},

The harmonic selection is based on the use of a tangent predictor and relies on a stepwise regression procedure that allows for a dynamic management of the number of selected harmonics via an addition or removal procedure. The efficiency of this method relative to the classical harmonic balance method (HBM) is then evaluated through examples; this later step will indicate that AHBM can significantly reduce the number of variables, thus leading to computational time savings without deteriorating solution quality.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of the dynamic characteristics of linear systems is now widely used and interest in non-linear systems has increased. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the performance of the restoring force surface method as far as the identification of non-linear systems is concerned. The vibrations of a clamped beam are investigated for two different kinds of non-linearity. Firstly, the beam shows a non-linear behaviour characterized by a piecewise linear stiffness and secondly, the non-linearity comes from a bilinear stiffness. Both numerical and experimental results are presented. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Because there is virtually no application of the NNMs to large-scale engineering structures, these papers are an attempt to highlight several aspects that might drive their development in the future. Specifically, we support that (i) numerical methods for the continuation of periodic solutions pave the way for an effective and practical computation of NNMs, and (ii) time-frequency analysis is particularly suitable for the analysis of the resulting dynamics. Another objective of the present paper is to describe, in simple terms, and to illustrate the fundamental properties of NNMs. This is achieved to convince the structural dynamicist not necessarily acquainted with them that they are a useful framework for the analysis of nonlinear vibrating structures.

We consider first the undamped system and perform a numerical study based on non-smooth transformations to determine its periodic solutions in a frequency–energy plot. It is found that there is a sequence of periodic solutions bifurcating or emanating from the main backbone curve of the plot. We then study analytically the periodic orbits of the undamped system using a complexification/averaging technique in order to determine the frequency contents of the various branches of solutions, and to understand the types of oscillation performed by the system at the different regimes of the motion. The transient responses of the weakly damped system are then examined, and numerical wavelet transforms are used to study the time evolutions of their harmonic components. We show that the structure of periodic orbits of the undamped system greatly influences the damped dynamics, as it causes complicated transitions between modes in the damped transient motion. In addition, there is the possibility of strong passive energy transfer (energy pumping) from the linear oscillator to the nonlinear attachment if certain periodic orbits of the undamped dynamics are excited by the initial conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Starting from the perspective of nonlinearities as internal feedback forces, a method in the time domain for the identification of nonlinear vibrating structures is described. Although its formulation is very simple, particular care has to be taken to reduce the ill-conditioning of the problem, in order to find numerically stable solutions. To this purpose the robustness and the high numerical performances of the subspace algorithms are successfully exploited, as demonstrated by the implementation of the method on simulated data from single and multi-degree of freedom systems with typical nonlinear characteristics. The method allows to estimate the coefficients of the nonlinearities away from the location of the applied excitations and also to identify the linear dynamic compliance matrix when the number of excitations is smaller than the number of response locations. The results comparison reported in this paper highlights the key advantage of the proposed method: the capability of treating multi-degree of freedom nonlinear systems holding different types of nonlinearities and the capability of selecting non-negligible nonlinear terms, with a light computational effort and with a limited number of time samples.

No information about the system mass is required, and only the applied excitation(s) and resulting acceleration are needed to implement the procedure. Arbitrary non-linear phenomena spanning the range from polynomial non-linearities to the noisy Duffing-van der Pol oscillator (involving product-type non-linearities and multiple excitations) or hysteretic behavior such as the Bouc-Wen model can be handled without difficulty. In the case of polynomial-type non-linearities, the approach yields virtually exact results for sufficiently rich excitations. For other types of non-linearities, the approach yields the optimum (in least-squares sense) representation in non-parametric form of the dominant interaction forces induced by the motion of the system. Several examples involving synthetic data corresponding to a variety of highly non-linear phenomena are presented to demonstrate the utility as well as the range of validity of the proposed approach.

  Abstract                 = {Most identification methods in non-linear structural dynamics assume in advance a mathematical model of the non-linearities. This is however possible in specific situations only, since non-linear effects may be caused by numerous phenomena and a priori knowledge is generally limited. The present paper investigates the usefulness of piecewise third-order polynomials, termed cubic splines, to identify the complex non-linear dynamics of solar arrays in their stowed configuration. The estimation of the model parameters is achieved using the frequency-domain non-linear subspace identification (FNSI) method. A distinct advantage of the FNSI approach is its capability to calculate accurately a large number of parameters, while maintaining an acceptable computational burden. This makes tractable the use of cubic splines to represent non-linearity in real-life mechanical systems, as the dimensionality of the inverse problem is known to increase dramatically in this case. The experimental structure of interest consists of two parallel aluminium plates assembled with bolted connections. This application is challenging because of the existence of impacts between the two plates at high excitation amplitude, and of the activation of complicated stiffness and damping mechanisms within the bolted connections.

  Abstract                 = {The objective of the present paper is to address the
 identification of a strongly nonlinear satellite structure. To
 this end, two nonlinear subspace identification methods
 formulated in the time and frequency domains are exploited,
 referred to as the TNSI and FNSI methods, respectively. The
 modal parameters of the underlying linear structure and the
 coefficients of the nonlinearities will be estimated by these
 two approaches based on periodic random measurements. Their
 respective merits will also be discussed in terms of both
 accuracy and computational efficiency and the use of
 stabilisation diagrams in nonlinear system identification will
 be introduced. The application of interest is the SmallSat
 spacecraft developed by EADS-Astrium, which possesses an
 impact-type nonlinear device consisting of eight mechanical
 stops limiting the motion of an inertia wheel mounted on an
 elastomeric interface. This application is challenging for
 several reasons including the non-smooth nature of the
 nonlinearities, high modal density and high non-proportional
 damping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) is discussed in the present paper and its companion, Part I. One reason of the still limited use of NNMs in structural dynamics is that their computation is often regarded as impractical. However, when resorting to numerical algorithms, we show that the NNM computation is possible with limited implementation effort, which paves the way to a practical method for determining the NNMs of nonlinear mechanical systems. The proposed algorithm relies on two main techniques, namely a shooting procedure and a method for the continuation of NNM motions. The algorithm is demonstrated using four different mechanical systems, a weakly and a strongly nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom system, a simplified discrete model of a nonlinear bladed disk and a nonlinear cantilever beam discretized by the finite element method.

The method is constructive for weakly non-linear systems and provides the physical nature of the normal modes along with the non-linear differential equations which govern their dynamics. It also provides the non-linear co-ordinate transformation which relates the original system co-ordinates to the modal co-ordinates. Using this transformation, the authors demonstrate how an approximate non-linear version of superposition can be employed to reconstruct the overall motion from the individual non-linear modal dynamics. The results presented herein for non-linear systems reduce to modal analysis for the linearized system when non-linearities are neglected, even though the approach is entirely different from the traditional one. The tools employed are from the theory of invariant manifolds for dynamical systems and were inspired by the center manifold reduction technique. The basic ideas are outlined, a few examples are presented and some natural extensions and applications of the method are briefly described in the conclusions.},

  abstract  = {We show how near-elastic vibro-impact problems, linear or nonlinear in-between impacts, can be conveniently analyzed by a discontinuity-reducing transformation of variables combined with an extended averaging procedure. A general technique for this is presented, and illustrated by calculating transient or stationary motions for different harmonic oscillators with stops or clearances, and self-excited friction oscillators with stops or clearances First- and second-order analytical predictions are derived, and shown to agree to estimated accuracy with results of numerical simulation.},
